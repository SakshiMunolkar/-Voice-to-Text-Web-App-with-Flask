# -Voice-to-Text-Web-App-with-Flask
I built a Voice-to-Text web application using Python, Flask, SpeechRecognition, and pyttsx3. The app allows users to record their voice through the browser, converts the speech into text using Google Speech API, and displays the recognized text on a beautiful, responsive web interface.
